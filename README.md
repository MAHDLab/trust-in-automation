# trust-in-automation
Analyzing experimental evidence on respondents' trust in automation to make political judgements

This repo is for the Machine Assisted Human Decision-making (MAHD) lab at the University of Houston, under direction of [Dr. Ryan Kennedy](https://ryanpkennedy.weebly.com/). It includes the working code for analyzing our experiments on people's trust in automation as they complete our forecasting (IFP) challenges. Importantly, this represents a work in progress, so update the code in the `R` script file, `code for analysis (working).R` accoringly.

Let me know if you have issues with the code/set up. See below for instructions on loading the data into your own environment. `# Load the data directly from Ryan's (TIA) DB or use the _here_ package`
